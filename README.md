# Many Things Planning:

For this project, I want to create a program that simulates a sky full of floating stars. The stars will move and change in appearance over time to create an animation. 
- The program will draw 10+ star shapes across the canvas.
-  Each star's size, brightness, and vertical position will gradually change to simulate floating effects.
-   Stars will reset to a new random position at the top of the canvas when they move off the bottom edge.

To further this project, I will add user interaction, such as clicking to generate new stars or using the keyboard to change the star colors. This will make the project more engaging.
